            So you decided to get some assistance with software development. You
            had a number of interviews, discussions and finally chose a vendor.
            Now the question is - how shall I cooperate with this vendor? What
            kind of engagement model is OK for me personally?
          </p>
          <p className="details__txt">
            If you are reading this article - that means that you got interested
            in the Dedicated Team Model of cooperation and we would like to make
            it clear for you what that is and you may decide if that is exactly
            what you are looking for.
          </p>
          <h2 className="details__gen">What is “Dedicated Team Model”?</h2>
          <p className="details__txt">
            To put it in a nutshell - this business model is an agreement
            between the client and service provider, when the latter setups a
            team of engineers who will work exclusively with a client on the
            agreed project/scope and as a rule that is for a long-time basis
            <br></br> Service provider conducts a search for team members based
            on the client`s needs and requirements. Nowadays Dedicated teams can
            work remotely or from the service provider`s office.<br></br> The
            working processes of the team can be managed by a client or by a
            project manager from a service provider`s side. The team works for
            the client on a regular basis, full-time.
          </p>
          <p className="details__txt">
            If the team is managed by the client - the performance, development
            progress and daily tasks are easily tracked by the client themselves
            and this gives them full awareness of the process.<br></br> In case
            the project manager is involved from the service provider`s side -
            we recommend daily sync up calls with the project manager (or
            weekly/biweekly with the team).<br></br> This model comes handy when
            the development plan isn`t clearly shaped up or the requirements for
            the solution have to be changed. This model is also advisable when
            your solution requires continuous maintenance.
          </p>
          <h2 className="details__gen">
            How does the Dedicated Team Model Work?

          <div className="details__numeration">
            <p className="details__numeration-text">
              <span>01.</span>
              The client understands his business needs and rolls out the
              criteria needed to cover the development which is not done
              in-house: tech stack and a number of employees needed.
            </p>
            <p className="details__numeration-text">
              <span>02.</span>
              The service provider collects the requirements and interviews the
              candidates (the client may be involved in the process or not - it
              is negotiable).
            </p>
            <p className="details__numeration-text">
              <span>03.</span>
              When all the interviews are settled down and the candidates are
              chosen the team and the client have to agree on the scope of the
              project and the requirements.
            </p>
            <p className="details__numeration-text">
              <span>04.</span>
              The collaboration starts when all the necessary preparations are
              done and the tasks are well formulated - this gives the team the
              possibility to work during.
            </p>
            <p className="details__numeration-text">
              <span>05.</span>
              The client has the possibility to track and control the process as
              well as monitor the progress, its workflow and the team.

                Dedicated Team is a great option when compared to hiring a team
                of your own. No pain with recruitment, screening, selection,
                interviews. You already have a team carved out for your project
                needs. Besides - no headache of wasting resources and time for
                recruitment.

                Dedicated team can be reshaped and reconfigured if there is such
                a need. You are also quite flexible in implementing new features
                or technologies for your project. You also have a full freedom
                to manage the team the way you want it and see it. This
                flexibility is very handy if the long-term project doesn`t have
                a full scope. You always have a chance for maneuver and at some
                points that is crucial.

                cooperation is the one the dedicated team model presupposes. The
                engineers get to know more of the client`s needs and business
                purposes and can suggest insights or solutions. This type of
                collaboration is not only efficient in terms of time and costs,
                but leads to development of worthy digital products and
                solutions.

                Low Efficiency During Short Terms
              </h2>
              <p className="writn__txt">
                This model is to be used more efficiently if we are talking
                about long-term projects. It comes really handy if you are not
                sure about the scope, terms, deadlines as it gives you a great
                possibility to be flexible.
                <br></br>
                But for the short-term projects we suggest a fixed price model.

                If you decide on the dedicated team model, then you should
                understand that you will need to invest a certain amount of your
                time in the management of the development process. If you are
                not ready to do so you shall think of other models of
                cooperation.

                Well, yeah. That might be a thing.
                <br></br>
                Most likely that you and your vendor will be in different time
                zones and sometimes that may be the case which can cause
                problems with timing for communication. Though as usual -
                efficient cooperation can only be achieved through the mutual
                effort of both parties.
                <br></br>
                Before choosing a particular model be sure to know what is the
                best environment for it. Thus you will avoid unnecessary risks
                or confusion.
                <br></br>
                That is why we advise to get a clear understanding of what you
                want to develop/achieve, do some ground research and decide what
                model will suit you best.

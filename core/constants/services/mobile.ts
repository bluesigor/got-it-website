Do your bit of substantial research and brainstorming before moving on to the next phase. And another important part of this phase is analyzing the competition. A detailed study of your competitor's app will help you figure out what features are absent in their app so that you could include it in your app, to make it stand out."

When planning to build an app, you need to consider it like a business. At the end of the day, all apps are designed to either make money directly through sales or advertisement income, or indirectly by making it easier for customers to use your service."
